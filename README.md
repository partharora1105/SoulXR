# SoulXR
Soul provides greater expression for physical real world objects by giving them interactive personas with faces, emotions, and voices. Imagine you walk in side a store, and each product sells itself, quite literally. With Meta's Presence Platform, it can activate when you look at it, detect your gestures like winking, thumbs up, even a middle finger. Based on that, using GPT generate responses and reactions based on the personality you give them. Different brands can have different personas they can attach to their products to bring them to life!
